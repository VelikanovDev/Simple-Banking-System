This program completely imitates the work of bank accounts. You can create accounts, replenish the balance, send money to another user and much more. When creating an account, the card number is generated using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm" target="_blank">Luhn algorithm</a>
, which is used to detect errors caused by unintentional data corruption (for example, when manually entering the card number, when receiving social security number data over the phone).
