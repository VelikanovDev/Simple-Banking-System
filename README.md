# Simple Banking System
The Banking Application is a simple console-based banking system that allows users to create accounts, log in, check balances, add income, transfer money between accounts, and close accounts.
When creating an account, the card number is generated using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm" target="_blank">Luhn algorithm</a>
, which is used to detect errors caused by unintentional data corruption (for example, when manually entering the card number, when receiving social security number data over the phone).
The application uses SQLite as a database to store account information.
